ConboJS-React example
=====================

Simple example application demonstrating how to integrate [ConboJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbo)
features into a React application, including an event bus, property injection,
commands and services.

This example uses the [Conbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbine) build 
of ConboJS, which is ConboJS with all the view classes removed.

To run the example, open a command line and enter:

```
npm i
npm start
```
