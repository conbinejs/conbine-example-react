ConboJS-React example
=====================

Simple example application demonstrating how to integrate
[ConboJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbo) features into a React application,
including an event bus, property injection, commands and services.

While the full version of ConboJS has been used in this instance, you could equally
use the the [Conbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbine) build, which has all
of the view related classes removed.

This example integrates with the React Context API, but if you'd prefer to take
a simpler approach using a global context, take a look at the `global` branch.

To run the example, open a command line and enter:

```
npm i
npm start
```
