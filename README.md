Conbine-React example
=====================

Simple example application demonstrating how to integrate
[Conbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbine) features into a React application,
including an event bus, property injection, commands and services.

This example integrates with the React Context API, but if you'd prefer to take
a simpler approach using a global context, take a look at the `global` branch.

To run the example, open a command line and enter:

```
npm i
npm start
```
