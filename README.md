Conbine-React example
=====================

Simple example application demonstrating how to integrate
[Conbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conbine) features into a React application,
including an event bus, property injection, commands and services.

This example integrates with the React Context API, but if you'd prefer to take a
simpler approach the same outcome could be achieved using an `import`ed global context.

To run the example, open a command line and enter:

```
npm i
npm start
```

Using class components?
-----------------------

This repo includes examples for both class and functional component, so just
switch to the branch that matches your preferred approach:

* [class-components](https://github.com/conbinejs/conbine-example-react/tree/class-components) for class components example
* [functional-components](https://github.com/conbinejs/conbine-example-react/tree/functional-components) for functional components example using hooks
